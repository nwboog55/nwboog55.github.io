This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the _Chirpy_ template, and it's worth reading even if you've used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.

## Naming and Path

Create a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION`{: .filepath} and put it in the `_posts`{: .filepath} of the root directory. Please note that the `EXTENSION`{: .filepath} must be one of `md`{: .filepath} and `markdown`{: .filepath}. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin [`Jekyll-Compose`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) to accomplish this.


```yaml
---
title: TITLE
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT
categories: [TOP_CATEGORY, SUB_CATEGORY]
tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase
---
```

> The posts' _layout_ has been set to `post` by default, so there is no need to add the variable _layout_ in the Front Matter block.

### Timezone of Date

To accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the `timezone` of `_config.yml`{: .filepath} but also provide the post's timezone in variable `date` of its Front Matter block. Format: `+/-TTTT`, e.g. `+0800`.

### Categories and Tags

The `categories` of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in `tags` can be zero to infinity. For instance:

```yaml
---
categories: [Animal, Insect]
tags: [bee]
---
```

### Author Information

The author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the _Front Matter_ , they will be obtained from variables `social.name` and the first entry of `social.links` of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:

Adding author information in `_data/authors.yml` (If your website doesn't have this file, don't hesitate to create one).

```yaml
<author_id>:
  name: <full name>
  twitter: <twitter_of_author>
  url: <homepage_of_author>
```
{: file="_data/authors.yml" }

And then use `author` to specify a single entry or `authors` to specify multiple entries:

```yaml
---
author: <author_id>                     # for single entry
# or
authors: [<author1_id>, <author2_id>]   # for multiple entries
---
```

Having said that, the key `author` can also identify multiple entries.

> The benefit of reading the author information from the file `_data/authors.yml`{: .filepath } is that the page will have the meta tag `twitter:creator`, which enriches the [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution) and is good for SEO.

### Post Description

By default, the first words of the post are used to display on the home page for a list of posts, in the _Further Reading_ section, and in the XML of the RSS feed. If you don't want to display the auto-generated description for the post, you can customize it using the `description` field in the _Front Matter_ as follows:

```yaml
---
description: Short summary of the post.
---
```

Additionally, the `description` text will also be displayed under the post title on the post's page.

## Table of Contents

By default, the **T**able **o**f **C**ontents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to `_config.yml`{: .filepath} and set the value of variable `toc` to `false`. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post's [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```yaml
---
toc: false
---
```

## Comments

The global setting for comments is defined by the `comments.provider` option in the `_config.yml`{: .filepath} file. Once a comment system is selected for this variable, comments will be enabled for all posts.

If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the **Front Matter** of the post:

```yaml
---
comments: false
---
```

## Media

We refer to images, audio and video as media resources in _Chirpy_.

### URL Prefix

From time to time we have to define duplicate URL prefixes for multiple resources in a post, which is a boring task that you can avoid by setting two parameters.

- If you are using a CDN to host media files, you can specify the `cdn` in `_config.yml`{: .filepath }. The URLs of media resources for site avatar and posts are then prefixed with the CDN domain name.

  ```yaml
  cdn: https://cdn.com
  ```
  {: file='_config.yml' .nolineno }

- To specify the resource path prefix for the current post/page range, set `media_subpath` in the _front matter_ of the post:

  ```yaml
  ---
  media_subpath: /path/to/media/
  ---
  ```
  {: .nolineno }

The option `site.cdn` and `page.media_subpath` can be used individually or in combination to flexibly compose the final resource URL: `[site.cdn/][page.media_subpath/]file.ext`
